Please see fib/src/README.txt for more details.

The intended file structure was be:

fib/src		// source code
   /tests	// test files
   /bin		// binary file outputs
   /objects	// object files

However, I was not able to correctly set everything up in this manner and have it work
correctly with makefiles, so as a compramise, all source code and binary files are
in the src/ folder including the makefile.
