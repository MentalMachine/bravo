Please see the README.txt in /fib/src and /brightSparkLabs/src for more details about each task

The intended structure of the /fib and /brightSparkLabs folders was:

/src    // for source code
/tests    // for test code
/objects    // for compiled objects
/bin     // for program binaries

However I could not get the makefile to work correctly with this intended strucuture, so all
files are in the respective /src folder.
